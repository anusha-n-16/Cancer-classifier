# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors as **Benign (B)** or **Malignant (M)** using machine learning models. The dataset used is the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)**, which contains 569 instances and 32 features describing various characteristics of cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **30 numerical features**, an **ID column (removed during preprocessing)**, and a **diagnosis label (B/M)**.

### Features:
- **Mean Features**: Mean values of tumor characteristics.
- **Standard Error Features**: Measures variability in tumor characteristics.
- **Worst Features**: Maximum values observed for each characteristic.

### Target Variable:
- **Diagnosis**: The outcome variable, where:
  - `B` (Benign) = **0**
  - `M` (Malignant) = **1**

### Class Distribution:
- **Benign (B)**: 357 cases (~62.7%)
- **Malignant (M)**: 212 cases (~37.3%)
- The dataset is slightly imbalanced, which is addressed using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Dropped 'ID' column** (not useful for classification).
- **Checked for missing values** (none found).
- **Encoded the target variable** (`B` â†’ 0, `M` â†’ 1).
- **Standardized features** using **StandardScaler**.
- **Handled class imbalance** using **SMOTE**.

## Models Used
I implemented and evaluated four machine learning models:
1. **Random Forest**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **XGBoost**

### Model Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

## Results
| Model                 | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score | ROC-AUC |
|-----------------------|----------|------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Random Forest        | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% |
| Logistic Regression  | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% |
| SVM                  | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% |
| XGBoost              | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% | xx.xx% |

(*Replace xx.xx% with actual results after model evaluation*)

## How to Run the Project

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of different machine learning models in diagnosing breast cancer. **XGBoost and Random Forest** provided the best performance in terms of accuracy and recall, making them ideal choices for this task. Further improvements can be made by hyperparameter tuning and incorporating deep learning models.
